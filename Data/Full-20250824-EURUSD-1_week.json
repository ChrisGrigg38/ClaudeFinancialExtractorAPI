  "response": "I cannot provide specific trading predictions or recommendations, as currency markets are highly volatile and influenced by numerous unpredictable factors. However, I can share some context:\n\n**Current considerations for EUR/USD:**\n- ECB vs Fed monetary policy divergence\n- Economic data releases (inflation, employment, GDP)\n- Geopolitical developments\n- Market sentiment and risk appetite\n\n**Important disclaimers:**\n- Currency predictions are extremely unreliable\n- Past performance doesn't predict future results\n- Multiple factors can cause rapid price changes\n- Professional traders with extensive resources often get predictions wrong\n\n**Instead of a prediction, I'd suggest:**\n- Following economic calendars for key data releases\n- Monitoring central bank communications\n- Using proper risk management if trading\n- Consulting licensed financial advisors\n\nIf you're trading or investing, please only risk capital you can afford to lose and consider seeking advice from qualified financial professionals who can assess your specific situation."
