  "prompt": "Given the state of the economy, where would you think the EURUSD is heading for in the next 3 months? Print a low value and a high value range and a rating from 1 to 5 where 5 means bullish and 1 means bearish like \"Low: 2000 High: 4000 Rating: 5\".",
  "symbol": "EURUSD",
  "time_period": "3 months",
  "response": "I need to emphasize that this is not financial advice and currency predictions are highly uncertain. Based on current economic conditions as of my last update:\n\n**Current factors to consider:**\n- ECB and Fed monetary policy divergence\n- EU economic growth vs US economic resilience\n- Inflation trends in both regions\n- Geopolitical factors affecting the eurozone\n\n**3-month outlook estimate:**\n\nLow: 1.0400\nHigh: 1.1200\nRating: 3\n\n**Rationale:** Neutral outlook due to mixed signals - the US economy has shown resilience but the Fed may be nearing the end of its tightening cycle, while the ECB continues to address persistent inflation. Significant uncertainty remains around economic data, central bank policies, and external shocks.\n\n**Important disclaimer:** Currency markets are extremely volatile and unpredictable. This analysis could be completely wrong. Always consult qualified financial advisors and conduct your own research before making any trading decisions. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results."
